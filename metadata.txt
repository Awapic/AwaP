description= This plugin takes in outlines of urban blocks and the boundary of area of interest, and calculates area-weighted average parameter (AwaP)
version=1.0
author=Ivan Majic

about=This plugin calculates area-weighted average perimeter (AwaP) of urban blocks within the defined area. The tool removes dead-end streets up to a specified maximum street width. This method was first presented in Pafka E. and Dovey K. (2017), Permeability and interface catchment: measuring and mapping walkable access (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17549175.2016.1220413).
